# Udemy Kurs 100-days-of-Code in Python #

https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/<br>

As preparation for my university studies, I completed an online course to learn the basics of programming.  
This repository contains the results of that training.

To make the covered topics easier to follow, I listed them in this README by categories such as basics, libraries, and additional languages. 
Note: Not all programs may run directly from GitHub, as some required files were excluded for security reasons.

The purpose of this repository is to give an overview of the skills I practiced independently in preparation for further academic work.
